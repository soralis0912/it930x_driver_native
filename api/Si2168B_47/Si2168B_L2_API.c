/* Change log: */
/* Last  changes:

  As from V0.3.8:
    <wrapper> Wrapper V2.4.4
    <correction> In Wrapper code, using dvbt2_cnr when in T2 (was inadvertently using dvbt_cnr as from wrapper V2.3.6)

  As from V0.3.7:
    <wrapper> Wrapper V2.4.1
    <firmware> With FW 4_4b17 for Si2168B-A40, Si2162-A40 and Si2160-A40 (patch with DVB-C2).
               With FW 4_0b19 for Si2169-B40 and Si2168B-40 (patch without DVB-C2, for smaller size and faster download).
    <TER_Tuner_API>[V0.3.9] Using TER-Tuner API V0.3.9, to benefit from the 1.7 MHz filtering feature (not available with all TER tuners).
    <improvement>[TER_BW/1.7MHz] In Si2168B_L2_Tune: now using SILABS_BW enum as defined in SiLABS_TER_TUNER API V0.3.9, to
      use the 1.7 MHz filtering feature in SiLabs TER tuners whenever possible.
    <correction> [Switch_to_standard/same_clock_source] In Si2168B_L2_switch_to_standard: condition to pass through
      the demod init simplified to a standard change. The previous version worked fine when changing the clock source, but not
      when using the same clock source for TER and SAT. Adding SiTRACES for flags used in the function.
    <improvement>[Src_code_GUIs] In Si2168B_L2_Test: more complete testpipe 'demod help'
    <correction>[Tuner_i2c] In Si2183_L2_Tune: Moving 'ifdef    UNICABLE_COMPATIBLE' line around the closing
      bracket after disabling the SAT tuner i2c.
      The previous version didn't disable the tuner i2c with the following compilation flags:
      UNICABLE_COMPATIBLE      NOT defined
      INDIRECT_I2C_CONNECTION  defined
    <correction>[SAT_Blindscan/Spectrum_Display/Unicable] In Si2168B_plot: correction of displayed frequencies when plotting the
      SAT spectrum in Unicable mode.
    <improvement> [Unicable/Multi-Treading/Multiple frontends] In Si2168B_L2_TER_FEF_SETUP: removing I2C pass-through enable/disable.
    This is only called from switch_to_standard, and the i2c pass-through is already enabled when calling this function.
    The change removes nested i2c pass-through enable/disable calls.
    These had generally no consequences, except for duals when several tuners use the same i2c address.

  As from V0.3.6:
    <correction> [SILENT/SLEEP/ANALOG] In Si2168B_L2_switch_to_standard: Adding dtv_demod_sleeping flag to
        more easily handle the 'sleep' mode, which can occur upon a clock source change in DTV, or when
        going to 'ANALOG' or 'ATV'. The WAKEUP sequence is required in the first case, not in the second case.

*/
/* Older changes:

  As from V0.3.5:
    <correction> [SILENT/SLEEP/ANALOG] Changing Si2168B_SILENT to use L2 content.
        This provides access to the TER_init_done and SAT_init_done flags
        These need to be set to 0 when calling Si2168B_SILENT(front_end,1), to trigger a call to Si2168B_Configure when re-starting DTV reception.

  As from V0.3.4:
    <wrapper>  Wrapper V2.3.6
    <firmware> With FW 4_4b16 for Si2168B-A40, Si2162-A40 and Si2160-A40 (patch with DVB-C2).
               With FW 4_0b18 for Si2169-B40 and Si2168B-40 (patch without DVB-C2, for smaller size and faster download).
    <improvement/DVB-T HP/LP> Setting dvbt_hierarchy.stream as Si2168B_DVBT_HIERARCHY_PROP_STREAM_HP.
      This allows locking on DVB-T hierarchical channels with low C/N allowing only HP reception
       (i.e. when the C/N is too low for a good lock on the LP stream).
    <improvement> [DUAL/TRIPLE/QUAD] In Si2168B_L2_switch_to_standard: over-riding clock flags if the clocks need to be always kept on or off
    <new feature> [SILENT] Adding Si2168B_SILENT, to allow settings all possible pins in tristate.
    <new feature> [SILENT] In Si2168B_L2_switch_to_standard: calling Si2168B_SILENT when called with either 'ANALOG' or 'SLEEP'
                           NB: when going to 'SLEEP', the TS pins are tristated. It is required to re-enable TS after the next lock.

  As from V0.3.3:
    <firmware> With FW 4_4b13 for Si2168B-A40, Si2162-A40 and Si2160-A40 (patch with DVB-C2).
               With FW 4_0b15 for Si2169-B40 and Si2168B-40 (patch without DVB-C2, for smaller size and faster download).

  As from V0.3.2:
    <wrapper>  Wrapper V2.3.6
    <improvement> [no_float] In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Init: Computing scan_fmin.scan_fmin and scan_fmax.scan_fmax using a method compatible with no float use.
                             In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Next: Tracing frequency values using a method compatible with no float use.
    <improvement> [no_float] In Si2168B_L2_lock_to_carrier:   Computing lpf using a method compatible with no float use.
    <improvement> [TRACES]   In Si2168B_L2_lock_to_carrier:   Tracing DVB-S and S2 afc ranges and lpf
    <improvement> [FEF] In Si2168B_L2_TER_FEF_SETUP: adding fef_level in call to SiLabs_TER_Tuner_FEF_FREEZE_PIN_SETUP.
              This function has been redefined to allow making the FEF level consistent between demodulator and tuner
    <correction>[TRACES] in Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Init: tracing afc ranges. The previous version didn't trace these values correctly

    <firmware> With FW 4_4b11 for Si2168B-A40, Si2162-A40 and Si2160-A40 (patch with DVB-C2).
               With FW 4_0b13 for Si2169-B40 and Si2168B-40 (patch without DVB-C2, for smaller size and faster download).
    <new_feature> [TestPipe] Adding Si2168B_L2_Health_Check

  As from V0.3.1:
    <new_feature> [SPI] Adding SPI code:
      In Si2168B_PowerUpWithPatch: calling Si2168B_LoadFirmwareSPI if api->spi_download is set
      Adding Si2168B_LoadFirmwareSPI function
    <improvement> [code_checkers] In Si2168B_L2_switch_to_standard: using snprintf with a fixed size of 1000.
                                  Declaring sequence with a length of 1000.
    <improvement> [code_checkers] In Si2168B_L2_Infos:  using snprintf with a fixed size of 1000.
                                  CAUTION: The message strings must be declared by the caller with a length of 1000.
  As from V0.3.0:
    <wrapper>  Wrapper V2.3.4
    <correction> [DVBT2/FEF] In Si2168B_L2_Tune: Activate FEF management in all cases where the signal can be DVB-T2
    <new_feature>[DVBT2/FEF] In Si2168B_L2_TER_FEF: Adding the 'DTV_AGC_AUTO_FREEZE' call, to help when receiving DVB-T2 with FEF.
            NB: This feature is only available for the most recent (as from Si21x8B) TER tuners.

  As from V0.2.9:
    <wrapper>  Wrapper V2.3.4
    <firmware> With FW 4_4b9  for Si2168B-A40, Si2162-A40 and Si2160-A40 (patch with DVB-C2).
               With FW 4_0b11 for Si2169-B40 and Si2168B-40 (patch without DVB-C2, for smaller size and faster download).
               With FW 3_Ab13 for ROM0 engineering samples, now without C2. C2 can't be fully supported with ROM0 parts.
    <correction> [DVBT2/FEF] In Si2168B_L2_TER_FEF_SETUP: connect tuner I2C before the FEF setup macros, as these macros need access to the tuner.
      As Si2168B_L2_TER_FEF_SETUP is only called from Si2168B_L2_switch_to_standard while the tuner i2c is connected there is no issue when using the
       SiLabs API wrapper as in the example console code. However, because the related macros used in Si2168B_L2_TER_FEF_SETUP issue tuner properties,
        it is better to enable I2C when entering the function, in case this function is called directly.

  As from V0.2.8:
    <wrapper>  Wrapper V2.3.4
    <firmware> With FW 4_4b8  for Si2168B-A40, Si2162-A40 and Si2160-A40 (patch with DVB-C2).
               With FW 4_0b10 for Si2169-B40 and Si2168B-40 (patch without DVB-C2, for smaller size and faster download).
               With FW 3_Ab13 for ROM0 engineering samples, now without C2. C2 can't be fully supported with ROM0 parts.

    <code_checkers> In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
      Added start_resume = 0, to avoid code checker warning. start_resume is always set by construction, as front_end->handshakeUsed
        can only be '0' or '1', but code checkers don't see this.
    <code_checkers> In Si2168B_L2_lock_to_carrier:
      Added new_lock = 1, to avoid code checker warning. start_resume is always set by construction, as front_end->handshakeUsed
        can only be '0' or '1', but code checkers don't see this.
    <code_checkers> In Si2168B_Media: adding missing break in switch.
    <improvement> [Si2160] In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Init: tracing DVB-T/T2 AFC ranges separately. (Si2160 doesn't support T2)

  As from V0.2.7:
  <correction>[BLINDSCAN/HANDSHAKE] In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
    Correct timeoutStartTime management.
      When 'blind_mode = 1' It worked if handshakeUsed = '0', but was improperly overwritten when handshakeUsed = '1'.
      If 'handshakeUsed = 1', force min_lock_time_ms to 0, to avoid waiting when using the handshake feature.
  <improvement>[BLINDSCAN/TRACES] In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
    Tracing the initial scan_ctrl.action only if 'blind_mode = 1'. (it's not relevant otherwise)
  <improvement>[DVB-T2-Lite] In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Init: removing dvbt2_mode.lock_mode (not forced to 'ANY'), to allow
        T/T2 scanning in 'T2-Base' mode. This flag is controlled via the default value set in Si2168B_storeUserProperties, and
      later on using the new wrapper function SiLabs_API_TER_T2_lock_mode
  <improvement>[DVB-T2-Lite] In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Next: returning dvbt2_status.t2_mode + 1 in *T2_base_lite, to match the
    values used in SiLabs_API_TER_T2_lock_mode (0='ANY', 1='T2-Base', 2='T2-Lite')

  As from V0.2.6:
    <firmware> With FW 4_4b7  for Si2168B-A40, Si2162-A40 and Si2160-A40 (patch with DVB-C2).
               With FW 4_0b9  for Si2169-B40 and Si2168B-40 (patch without DVB-C2, for smaller size and faster download).
               With FW 3_Ab12 for ROM0 engineering samples, now without C2. C2 can't be fully supported with ROM0 parts.
    <improvement> [BLINDSCAN/DVB-C] In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Init: forcing dvbc_constellation.constellation to 'AUTO'.
                    Otherwise only the current constellation is detected.
    <new feature> [MCNS] In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Init, Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Next : adding MCNS support.
    <new feature> [TESTPIPE] Adding DVB-T2 signaling support
    <improvement> [TESTPIPE] In Si2168B_L2_Test: tracing additional properties.
    <improvement> [TER AGC]  In Si2168B_L2_TER_AGC: checking AGC TER settings to set front_end->demod->tuner_ter_agc_control at '0'
                              when the TER AGC is not controlled from the demodulator
                             In Si2168B_L2_switch_to_standard:
                              Setting TER AGC to 'EXTERNAL' only if front_end->demod->tuner_ter_agc_control is '1'
    <traces> [BLINDSCAN] In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Init: tracing AFC ranges
    <traces> [BLINDSCAN DEBUG] In Si2168B_plot: spectrum traces now OK for DVB-C blindscan
    <traces> [DVB-T2] In Si2168B_lock_to_carrier: tracing T2 lock mode
    <traces> [BLINDSCAN] In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Next: tracing max_lock_time_ms

  As from V0.2.5:
    <firmware> With FW 4_4b4 for Si2168B-A40, Si2162-A40 and Si2160-A40 (patch with DVB-C2).
               With FW 4_0b6 for Si2169-B40 and Si2168B-40 (patch without DVB-C2, for smaller size and faster download).
               With FW 3_Ab11 for ROM0 engineering samples, now without C2. C2 can't be fully supported with ROM0 parts.
    <correction> In FW: Having scan_status.buz flag set to 'buzy' at API level before being set to 'buzy' in the MCU code.
                         Before this, SCAN_CTRL errors could occur if SCAN_CTRL/START was issued less than (about) 10 ms after SCAN_CTRL/ABORT.
                         This occurred on platforms with 'fast' i2c, when calling Seek_Init/Seek_Next very fast, when it was 'buzy'
                          in MCU but wasn't reported as 'buzy' at API level..
                 In SW:  Before issuing SCAN_CTRL/START, the SW now checks the scan_status.buz field, making sure it's not 'buzy'.
    <improvement> [BLINDSCAN] In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Next: tracing and waiting for 'buz=0' before issuing SCAN_CTRL START/RESUME
    <improvement> [BLINDSCAN] In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Init  enabling BUZINT interrupt, to get the scan_status.buz status visible
                               in status.scanint
    <improvement> [ATV] In Si2168B_L2_switch_to_standard:
      When switching to ATV, forcing the demodulator for DVB-T/non auto detect reception before POWER_DOWN
      This is to make sure that the FEF pin will be at the level defined by DD_MP_DEFAULTS
    <new feature>  In Si2168B_L2_Test (if SILABS_API_TEST_PIPE):
      Adding DVB-T2 signalling code (used by 'l1_pre'/'l1_post'/'l1_misc' options. NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL YET

  As from V0.2.4:
    <wrapper>  Wrapper V2.3.1
    <firmware> With FW 4_4b3 for Si2168B-A40, Si2162-A40 and Si2160-A40 (patch with DVB-C2).
               With FW 4_0b5 for Si2169-B40 and Si2168B-40 (patch without DVB-C2, for smaller size and faster download)
               With FW 3_Ab9 for ROM0 engineering samples, now without C2. C2 can't be fully supported with ROM0 parts.
    <correction>  [T/T2] In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Init:
     Moving DD_MODE after all DD_MODE property fields are set (previous version had issues with 7MHz/8MHz TER scan transition)
     Moving DD_RESTART after all properties are set (not really required, as there is another DD_RESTART in Seek_Next, but better for clarity)
    <correction>  [S/S2/DSS] In Si2168B_L2_SAT_LPF: (if INDIRECT_I2C_CONNECTION) calling the proper callback function to connect the SAT tuner.
      This probably never created any issue, as most applications generally connect both tuners via the same demodulator
    <correction>  [MCNS] In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_End: adding the MCNS case.
    <improvement> [T]    In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Init: forcing dvbt_hierarchy.stream to keep track of the current stream selection
    <improvement> [T]    In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Next: storing dvbt_hierarchy.stream in *stream
    <improvement> [MCNS] In Si2168B_L2_lock_to_carrier:
      Using  Si2168B_DVB_C_max_lock_ms for MCNS, as for DVB-C. (Only impacting MCNS time out)
      Removing duplicate timeout settings in MCNS
    <new feature>  clock_control:
      Adding 'int clock_control' to Si2168B_L2_TER_Clock and Si2168B_L2_SAT_Clock functions.
      This is used for multi-frontends applications when a tuner's clock is forwarded to another frontend.
        In this case it needs to be 'ALWAYS_ON'.
        To keep the previous behavior, use '2' (i.e. the 'MANAGED' mode)
      In Si2168B_L2_switch_to_standard: managing tuner clocks depending on the corresponding clock_control values.
    <new feature>  In Si2168B_L2_Test (if SILABS_API_TEST_PIPE):
      Adding 'download' option, to allow controlling the propertyWriteMode from the SILABS_API_TEST_PIPE
      Adding 'dump' option, useful for debugging difficult cases
      Adding 'init_done' / 'clock_on' / 'clock_off' / 'init_after_reset' / 'standby' / 'wakeup' options for TER and SAT
    <traces>      In Si2168B_DVB_C_max_lock_ms: tracing the resulting value
    <cleanup>     In Si2168B_typedefs.h: removing unused declarations
    <cleanup>     In Si2168B_L2_lock_to_carrier: Unwanted info text removed from function documentation
    <cleanup>     Removing seekRunning from Si2168B_L2_Context (unused)

  As from V0.2.3:
    With wrapper V2.3.0.
    This corrects an improper type change in SiLabs_API_lock_to_carrier, which broke the DVB-C AUTO QAM capability.
    Changes are limited to the wrapper code.

  As from V0.2.2:
    Adding fef_pin and fef_level in L1_Si2168B_Context
    Adding Si2168B_L2_TER_FEF_CONFIG, to make it easy to configure the FEF for DVB-T2
     NB: The FEF configuration can't be identical for both dies in a dual demod,
          where DEMOD A can only control MP_A/MP_C, DEMOD B can only control MP_B/MP_D.
         The typical use case is:
             | DEMOD A (Die 1) | DEMOD B (Die 2) |
     TER AGC | MP_A (agc2)     | MP_B (agc2)     |
     SAT AGC | MP_C (agc1)     | MP_D (agc1)     |
     TER FEF | MP_C (active 1) | MP_D (active 1) |
     This is obtained after calling:
     For DEMOD A:
      Si2168B_L2_TER_AGC    ('front_end[A]', 0x0, 0, 0xa, 0);
      Si2168B_L2_SAT_AGC    ('front_end[A]', 0xc, 1, 0x0, 0);
      Si2168B_L2_TER_FEF_CONFIG('front_end[A]', 1, 0xc, 1);
     For DEMOD B:
      Si2168B_L2_TER_AGC    ('front_end[B]', 0x0, 0, 0xb, 0);
      Si2168B_L2_SAT_AGC    ('front_end[B]', 0xd, 1, 0x0, 0);
      Si2168B_L2_TER_FEF_CONFIG('front_end[B]', 1, 0xd, 1);
    In Si2168B_Configure:
     Configure DD_MP_DEFAULTS based on fef_pin/fef_level values, including limitations for dual demodulators.
     Remove dvbt2_fef fields setup, as it's now in Si2168B_L2_TER_FEF_CONFIG.
     Apply DVBT2_FEF command when in TER.
      To be configured like with the previous version, call Si2168B_L2_TER_FEF_CONFIG(front_end, 0xb, 1);
     Trace Die if dual part
    In Si2168B_L2_Part_Check:
      Correcting typo (',' instead of ';' at the end of one line)
    Changing Si2168B_L2_switch_to_standard and Si2168B_L2_set_standard function definitions to use 'unsigned char' instead of 'int' for standard.
    Changing Si2168B_L2_lock_to_carrier function definitions to use 'unsigned char' instead of 'int' for standard/stream/constellation/polarization/band/T2_lock_Mode.
     This avoids casting the related values to (unsigned int) within the functions when compiled with '-pedantic'.
      data_slice_id and plp_id are kept as 'int', as they may take a value of '-1' at wrapper level to select the corresponding 'auto' modes.
    In Si2168B_L2_lock_to_carrier:
      Clean up of calls to DVBT2_PLP_SELECT:
        Removed one redundant call.
        Now using similar calls in both places (AUTO_T_T2 and T2-only).
      Casting plp_id and dataslice_id to 'unsigned char' when stored in command fields.
        This is required because those can be set to '-1' to select the 'auto' mode.
      Clean up of some SiTRACE: using %ld for 'long' types
    In Si2168B_L2_Test:
      Limiting string lengths below 500 in sprintf and printf, to avoid warnings when compiled with '-pedantic'

  As from V0.2.1:
   With Wrapper V2.2.8
   With FW 4_4b2 for Si2168B-A40, Si2162-A40 and Si2160-A40 (patch with DVB-C2).
   With FW 4_0b4 for Si2169-B40 and Si2168B-40 (patch without DVB-C2, for smaller size and faster download)
   With FW 3_Ab7 for ROM0 engineering samples, now without C2. C2 can't be fully supported with ROM0 parts.
   In Si2168B_L2_lock_to_carrier:
     Adding an option to allow testing the relock time upon a reset (if freq<0)
     Reducing lock check wait from 10 to 5 ms

  As from V0.2.0:
   Corrected tag used by the export tool
   With FW 3_Ab6 for ROM0 engineering samples, now without C2. C2 can't be fully supported with ROM0 parts.
   Updating Si2168B_plot function to get the proper spectrum display during blindscan.

  As from V0.1.9:
   Moving FW files inclusion after including Si2168B_L2_API.h (useful for export tools).
   With FW 4_4b1 for Si2168B-A40, Si2162-A40 and Si2160-A40 (patch with DVB-C2)
   With FW 4_0b3 for Si2169-B40 and Si2168B-40 (patch without DVB-C2, for smaller size and faster download)
   With FW 3_Ab5 for ROM0 engineering samples, now without C2. C2 can't be fully supported with ROM0 parts.

   Adding Si2168B_LoadFirmware_16 function, to allow faster FW download (in 16 bytes mode)

   In Si2168B_PowerUpWithPatch:
    Adding code to:
     Load a patch with DVB-C2 in Si2168B/62/60 ROM1 parts (checking all PART_INFO fields)
     Load a smaller patch     in Si2169B/68B  ROM1 parts (checking all PART_INFO fields)

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   WARNING 1:
    The compilation flags have been changed to match the final part marking:
      The code is now using Si2168B_40_COMPATIBLE (instead of Si2168B_40_COMPATIBLE) and Si2168B_ES_COMPATIBLE
      It is required to change the compilation flags at project level.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   WARNING 2:
    ROM0 (engineering samples) parts will not support DVB-C2 anymore, as there is not enough memory left to
      support the DVB-C2 patches together with the other standards.
    To experiment with DVB-C2, use ROM1 parts (with Si216x-y40 marking).
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   In Si2168B_L2_Test:
     Adding MCM infos in 'get_rev' option

  As from V0.1.8:
   With FW 3_Ab5
   In Si2168B_L2_lock_to_carrier:
     Adding T2_lock_mode flag (selects whether to lock on the T2-Base or T2-Lite signal (o='any'))
     WARNING: data_slice_id parameter now before plp_id, to match the wrapper code and the C2 system logic
               (In a C2 system, the data slice is selected first, then the PLP is selected inside the data slice).
   In Si2168B_L2_switch_to_standard:
    Using TER_TUNER_DTV_LIF_OUT_AMP to set DTV_LIF_OUT differently for 'qam' and 'ofdm' TER reception
   In Si2168B_L2_lock_to_carrier:
    C2 locking capability added, with dual-tune if not on the final frequency for the selected dataslice.
   In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Init:
    Setting T2 lock mode to 'any'
    Setting C2 select mode to 'AUTO'
   In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
    Adding T2_base_lite flag  (indicates whether the locked signal is T2-Base or T2-Lite)
    C2 scan capability added.

  As from V0.1.7:
   In Si2168B_L2_switch_to_standard:
    Using TER_TUNER_DTV_LIF_OUT to set DTV_LIF_OUT differently for 'cable' and 'terrestrial' reception
   In wrapper code: adding DVB-C SSI/SQI in SiLabs_API_SSI_SQI

  As from V0.1.6:
   In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Next: moving timeoutStartTime setup right before DD_RESTART.

  As from V0.1.5:

    In Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
     In DVB-T: using front_end->seekStepHz as the step when not locked.
               using front_end->seekBWHz   as the step when locked.

  As from V0.1.4:

    API changes:
      Adding new field in property DD_TS_MODE_PROP: ts_freq_resolution
      Adding new property DD_TS_SERIAL_DIFF

  As from V0.1.3:

    Compatibility with the SILABS_SAT_TUNER_API, the new method used to control satellite tuners,
     with no change in the demodulator code.
     (this requires compiling with the SiLabs_SAT_Tuner code and defining SAT_TUNER_SILABS at project level).
    Adding Si2168B_L2_TER_AGC and Si2168B_L2_SAT_AGC functions, to make it easy to configure the AGCs

  As from V0.1.2:

    With FW 3_Ab3

    API change: adding mcm_die field in GET_REV reply (0 = SINGLE, 1 = DIE_A, 2 = DIE_B)

    Compatibility with the SILABS_TER_TUNER_API, the new method used to control SiLabs terrestrial tuners,
     with no change in the demodulator code.
     (this requires compiling with the SiLabs_TER_Tuner code and defining TER_TUNER_SILABS at project level).

    Compatibility with INDIRECT_I2C_CONNECTION compilation, a mode allowing tuner access from other demoulators,
     used for multi-frontend applications

    Adding Si2168B_L2_TER_Clock and Si2168B_L2_SAT_Clock functions, to make it easy to configure the clock paths

    In Si2168B_L2_switch_to_standard: adding C2 case when setting flags

    In Si2168B_L2_lock_to_carrier and Si2168B_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
     Rework of the handshake feature with different flags used to check several items:
      A- The time spent in the function (to return if in handshake mode and longer than handshakePeriod_ms)
      B- The total time spent trying to lock/detect a channel (compared to the max allowed time)
      C- The time between 2 interactions with the FW (making sure the FW is running as expected).

  As from V0.1.1.3Ab2:   With FW 3_Ab2
  As from V0.1.1.3Ab1:   With FW 3_Ab1

  As from V0.1.1:
   Adding DD_DISEQC_PARAM property, to select the sequence mode between 'Unicable' and 'Normal' SAT modes

  As from V0.1.0:
   First version after receiving the silicon.

  As from V0.0.3 (in preparation):
   Adding Si2168B_L2_prepare_diseqc_sequence and Si2168B_L2_trigger_diseqc_sequence to allow preparing
    the DiSEqC message and sending it in two steps. This is required for Unicable with Si2168B, as otherwise the
    preparation takes too much time to stay within the Unicable Td specification (4 to 22 ms)

 As from V0.0.2:
  Compiled for ROM 0 firmware 0_A_build_1
  Si2168B_L2_Test_MPLP renamed Si2168B_L2_Test_T2_MPLP
  In Test pipe:
   Retrieving C2 system info

  Use:      relocking function
            Used to relock on a channel for the current standard
            options:
              if freq = 0, do not tune. This is useful to test the lock time without the tuner delays.
              if freq < 0, do not tune and don't change settings. Just do a DD_RESTART. This is useful to test the relock time upom a reset.
  Parameter: standard the standard to lock to
  Parameter: freq                the frequency to lock to    (in Hz for TER, in kHz for SAT)
  Parameter: dvb_t_bandwidth_hz  the channel bandwidth in Hz (only for DVB-T and DVB-T2)
  Parameter: dvb_t_stream        the HP/LP stream            (only for DVB-T)
  Parameter: symbol_rate_bps     the symbol rate             (for DVB-C, MCNS and SAT)
  Parameter: dvb_c_constellation the DVB-C constellation     (only for DVB-C)
  Parameter: data_slice_id       the DVB-C2 data slice Id    (only for DVB-C2)
  Parameter: plp_id              the PLP Id                  (only for DVB-T2 and DVB-C2 when num_dslice  > 1)
  Parameter: T2_lock_mode        the DVB-T2 lock mode        (0='ANY', 1='T2-Base', 2='T2-Lite')
  Return:    1 if locked, 0 otherwise

  Si2168B_L2_TER_FEF_SETUP function
  Use:        TER tuner LPF setting function
              Used to configure the FEF mode in the terrestrial tuner
  Comments:   If the tuner is connected via the demodulator's I2C switch, enabling/disabling the i2c_passthru is required before/after tuning.
  Behavior:   This function closes the Si2168B's I2C switch then sets the TER FEF mode and finally reopens the I2C switch
  Parameter:  *front_end, the front-end handle
  Parameter:  fef, a flag controlling the selection between FEF 'off'(0) and FEF 'on'(1)
